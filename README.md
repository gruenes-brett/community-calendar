# Events Calendar Wordpress Plugin

The purpose of this plugin is to provide a straight-forward way of
displaying a calendar with public events. Users may submit events and have
them displayed in the calendar (after they have been revised and activated by
a page admin).


## Usage

The plugin introduces its functionality using short codes:

* Show the calendar, starting today:
```
[events-calendar-table startToday=true/]
```
* Display floating buttons that allow the user to submit an event and to scroll
 back to the current day
 ```
 [events-calendar-buttons/]
 ```
